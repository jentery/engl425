# Description 

Comics are integral to the study of America and American fiction today. They experiment with representation, play with genre, speak truth to power, and prompt important conversations about fiction's role in memory and culture. We'll discuss these topics and more by engaging the politics and aesthetics of comics and sampling various critical approaches to the combination of words, images, and narrative in contemporary America. You'll learn how comics work and how to write about them for popular and academic audiences. 

# Aims 

You will learn to:

1. Demonstrate various strategies for approaching comics. You'll develop a vocabulary for talking about them, too. 
2. Interpret comics in the context of fiction and contemporary America (2000 to the present). You'll have an opportunity to attend to histories of comics and their genres. 
3. Identify techniques people use to compose comics and explain why the aesthetics of comics matter today. 
4. Articulate the relationship between comics and power, including the subversive and normative elements of comics. 
5. Communicate critically both *about* comics and *with* them. This means you'll treat comics as not only evidence or examples (*about*) but also ways of experiencing and understanding the world (*with*). 

# About Us 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him / his; jentery@uvic.ca). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) at UVic. I also direct the [Praxis Studio](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/) for Comparative Media Studies. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington in Seattle, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I've been at UVic since 2011, and I teach courses on American fiction, media and cultural studies, and experimental prototyping. This is the 35th class I've taught here, but only my third online. I'll be learning a bit as we go. Thanks for your patience.

And my name is Faith Ryan (she / her / hers). I'm a settler on unceded Lekwungen and <u>W̱</u>SÁNEĆ lands, and I am grateful for the years I've been able to study here. I'm a graduate student in English at UVic, and I did my BA at UVic as well. I'm originally from Ogden, Utah, but I spent most of my high school years in the lower mainland BC. I like contemporary Canadian and American fiction and approaching culture, in all its forms, from a disability studies perspective. Feel free to reach out over the term, even if you're unsure whether it's something I can assist you with. If it isn't, then I can point you in the right direction. I hope you enjoy the course!
