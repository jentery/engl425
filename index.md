# Description 

Comics are integral to the study of America and American fiction today. They experiment with representation, play with genre, speak truth to power, and prompt important conversations about fiction's role in memory and culture. We'll discuss these topics and more by engaging the politics and aesthetics of comics and sampling various critical approaches to the combination of words, images, and narrative in contemporary America. You'll learn how comics work and how to write about them for popular and academic audiences. 

# Aims 

You will learn to:

1. Demonstrate various strategies for approaching comics. You'll develop a vocabulary for talking about them, too. 
2. Interpret comics in the context of fiction and contemporary America (2000 to the present). You'll have an opportunity as well to attend to histories of comics and their genres. 
3. Identify techniques people use to compose comics and to explain why the aesthetics of comics matter today. 
4. Articulate the relationship between comics and power, including the subversive and popular elements of comics. 
5. Communicate critically both *about* comics and *with* them. This means you'll treat comics as not only evidence or examples (*about*) but also ways of experiencing and understanding the world (*with*).
