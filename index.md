# Description 

Comics are integral to the study of America and American fiction today. They experiment with representation, play with genre, speak truth to power, and prompt important conversations about fiction's role in memory and catharsis. We'll discuss these topics and more by engaging the politics and aesthetics of comics and sampling various critical approaches to the combination of words, images, and narrative in contemporary America. You'll learn how comics work and how to write about them for popular and academic audiences.
