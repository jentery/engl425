# Description 

Comics are integral to the study of America and American fiction today. They experiment with representation, play with genre, speak truth to power, and prompt important conversations about fiction's role in memory and culture. We'll discuss these topics and more by engaging the politics and aesthetics of comics and sampling various critical approaches to the combination of words, images, and narrative in contemporary America. You'll learn how comics work and how to write about them for popular and academic audiences. 

# Aims 

You will learn to:

1. Demonstrate various strategies for approaching comics. You'll develop a vocabulary for talking about them, too. 
2. Interpret comics in the context of fiction and contemporary America (2000 to the present). You'll have an opportunity to attend to histories of comics and their genres. 
3. Identify techniques people use to compose comics and explain why the aesthetics of comics matter today. 
4. Articulate the relationship between comics and power, including the subversive and normative elements of comics. 
5. Communicate critically both *about* comics and *with* them. This means you'll treat comics as not only evidence or examples (*about*) but also ways of experiencing and understanding the world (*with*). 

# About Us 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him / his; jentery@uvic.ca). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT) at UVic. I also direct the [Praxis Studio](https://uvicpraxis.github.io/) for Comparative Media Studies. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington in Seattle, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I've been at UVic since 2011, and I teach courses on American fiction, media and cultural studies, and experimental prototyping. This is the 35th class I've taught here, but only my third online. I'll be learning a bit as we go. Thanks for your patience.

And my name is Faith Ryan (she / her / hers). I'm a settler on unceded Lekwungen and <u>W̱</u>SÁNEĆ lands, and I am grateful for the years I've been able to study here. I'm a graduate student in English at UVic, and I did my BA at UVic as well. I'm originally from Ogden, Utah, but I spent most of my high school years in the lower mainland BC. I like contemporary Canadian and American fiction and approaching culture, in all its forms, from a disability studies perspective. Feel free to reach out over the term, even if you're unsure whether it's something I can assist you with. If it isn't, then I can point you in the right direction. I hope you enjoy the course! 

# Assignments

We are asking you to respond to *four* [prompts](#prompts) this term, and we'll invite you to revise one of those responses. Each response will constitute 25% of your final grade. 

There are no quizzes, exams, discussion forums, or student presentations in this course. There is no participation mark, either. Both of us will grade your responses to the prompts and return feedback via Brightspace. We'll also provide you with tips for responding to each prompt. 

All the [prompts](#prompts) are included in this outline, and due dates are provided in the [schedule](#schedule). Please submit each of your responses via Brightspace. (See submission links in the [schedule](#schedule).) We cannot accept submissions by email. 

Please note that each prompt affords two ways to respond. You should pick *one* of the two and consider your audience (mentioned in the prompt) as you respond. Not all of the responses are academic essays. 

# Meetings

We will meet on **Mondays from 11:30am to 12:50pm**. Please check your email and/or Brightspace for the Zoom URL, which will remain the same for the entire term. 

Meetings will combine lecture with group discussion and the occasional breakout room. Please come to each session prepared to discuss the assigned material. We will invite you to comment on the [comics](#comics) we're reading and to talk about them with other people in the class. Your contributions during a given meeting may be communicated through text, audio, and/or video in Zoom. 

A video recording of each meeting will be circulated via Brightspace.

# Workload

One of the most important things to know about this course is that **we'll opt for care in every instance.** If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then Faith and I will cut materials, including assignments, as we go. We've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.  

We suggest dedicating 3 to 5 hours of study each week to this course, plus 1.5 hours for the weekly [meetings](#meetings). To frame expectations and decrease overwork, we assign in the [schedule](#schedule) a number of recommended hours to each aspect of the course, and we communicate progress in terms of weekly steps (0-13) toward completing the course, partially because online learning makes time weird for us all, and focusing on anything can be a struggle right now.

Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work, concepts, and comics involved. 

# Comics  

Here's a list of the comics we'll read this term. They're available at the [UVic Bookstore](https://www.uvicbookstore.ca/text/). You are also welcome to read them as ebooks on a tablet or in your browser, if you'd prefer. You should spend no more than $117 (before taxes) on these books. Purchasing used copies or ebooks, or relying on subscription services, will save you money. (Ebooks may total as little as $47 for this course, saving you up to $70 before taxes.)

* *Ms. Marvel*, Vol. 1: *No Normal* (2014), by G. Willow Wilson, Adrian Alphona, and Jake Wyatt
* Victor LaValle's *Destroyer* (2017), by Victor LaValle and Dietrich Smith

I will also share examples of work by some (or perhaps all) of the following authors during our meetings throughout the term: Weshoyot Alvitre, Kyle Baker, Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Charles Burns, Emily Carroll, Kelly Sue DeConnick, Will Eisner, Sigrid Ellis, Emil Ferris, Matt Fraction, Neil Gaiman, Kieron Gillen, Roberta Gregory, Joy Harjo, the Hernandez brothers, Stephen Graham Jones, Tom King, Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, Jeff Lemire, David Mazzuchelli, Scott McCloud, Jamie McKelvie, Carla Speed McNeil, Alan Moore, Robert Morales, Brennan Lee Mulligan, Molly Ostertag, Greg Rucka, Gail Simone, Art Spiegelman, Fiona Staples, Brian K.

The schedule for this course is coming soon. 

# Policies 

### Prerequisites 

There are no prerequisites for this 400-level English course. 

### Brightspace 

We will rely as little as possible on Brightspace for this course. We will not use it for discussions, surveys, or polls, and you won't need it to write or produce any of your assignments. You should be able to find most of what you need here, in this course outline, which---for the sake of access---we copied into Brightspace. This way, you can rely entirely on Brightspace, if you prefer. 

All that said, we will use Brightspace for: 

1. Class announcements, which you may also receive by email (see your Brightspace settings).
2. Circulating video recordings of weekly Zoom meetings.
3. Accessing your responses to the four [prompts](#prompts). Links to submit those responses are available in the [schedule](#schedule).
4. Returning feedback and your marks.  

If you cannot access the course Brightspace, then please let us know. 

### Assessment 

Responses to two of the four prompts are required to pass this course. Failure to complete these two assignments will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). 

Faith and I will use UVic's [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/undergrad/index.php#/policy/S1AAgoGuV?bc=true&bcCurrent=14%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to assess your four responses. We do not post marks publicly or outside our offices, and we do not use plagiarism detection software.

### Late Submissions and Extensions

If you need to request an extension or you're concerned about the possibility of a late submission, then please email us. We understand that extensions may be necessary for numerous reasons, especially right now. 

### Communications 

The best way to communicate with us is by email (jentery@uvic.ca), during weekly meetings (Mondays, 11:30am - 12:50pm) and office hours (Mondays, 1-2pm), and by appointment (phone or Zoom). 

We respond to work email between 9am and 5pm, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays. 

### Feedback 

We will provide feedback via Brightspace on each of the four assignments. 

Throughout the term, we'll request feedback from you on how the course is going. We'll also ask you to complete Course Experience Surveys at the end of term.

### Attendance and Participation

Please attend the weekly Zoom meetings (Mondays, 11:30am - 12:50pm) and participate in those discussions via text, video, and/or audio. Video recordings of these meetings will be circulated via Brightspace. 

There is no participation mark for this course.   

### Learning Climate  

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. We are expected to adhere to [UVic's equity and human rights policies](https://www.uvic.ca/equity/). You should alert me immediately if you have any questions about these policies and their application, or if you have concerns about course proceedings or participants.

### Academic Integrity  

We are expected to adhere to [UVic's academic integrity policy](https://www.uvic.ca/current-students/home/academics/academic-integrity/index.php) and be aware of the policies for the evaluation of student course work. Violations of the integrity policy will result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, you agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review. We do not use software to detect plagiarism in essays or any other assignments.

### Copyright 

All course materials are made available for educational purposes and for the exclusive use of students in this course. The material is protected under copyright law, even if not marked as such. The syllabus itself is licensed [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). Any further use or distribution of materials to others requires our written permission, except under fair dealing or another exception in the Copyright Act. Violations may result in disciplinary action under the Resolution of Non-Academic Misconduct Allegations policy (AC1300). 

### Accessibility and Accommodation 

Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. If you have a disability or health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach us and/or the [Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL)](https://www.uvic.ca/services/cal/) as soon as possible. CAL staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the quicker we can assist you in achieving your learning goals.

### Diversity and Inclusion 

We want to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences, and also honours your identities across race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, and ability. Integrating diverse and different experiences is important for any critical approach to comics and fiction. We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something is said in class (by anyone, including one of us) that makes you feel uncomfortable, don't hesitate to talk with us. If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your University records, please let us know. If you feel like your performance in the class is being impeded by your experiences outside class, please don't hesitate to talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. You can also submit anonymous feedback, which, with your permission, we may use to make a general announcement to the course. If you prefer to speak with someone outside the course, Michael Nowlin (Chair, Department of English), is an excellent resource. Finally, please contact us or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course.

(Language for this policy was drawn from the Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning at Brown University, and from the work of Monica Linden, in particular.)

### Online Conduct 

The University of Victoria is committed to promoting critical academic discourse while providing a respectful and supportive learning environment. All members of the University community have the right to this experience and the responsibility to help create such an environment. The University will not tolerate racism, sexualized violence, or any form of discrimination, bullying, or harassment. 

Please be advised that, by logging into UVic’s learning systems and interacting with online resources, you are engaging in a University activity. All interactions within this environment are subject to University expectations and policies. Any concerns about student conduct may be reviewed and responded to in accordance with the appropriate University policy. To report concerns about online student conduct, email onlineconduct@uvic.ca. 

### Basic Needs 

We want you to thrive in this course and everywhere else. Please let us know as early as possible if you have any concerns or if you require any assistance to succeed. We'll do our best to help.

If you need to cover gaps in care, then please don't hesitate to bring your children to class meetings. Babies who are nursing are always welcome, as we do not want you to choose between feeding your child and continuing your education. 

UVic takes student mental health very seriously, with a [website](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth/) full of resources. We offer services such as assistance and referral to address students' personal, social, career, and academic concerns. Services for students also include crisis and emergency mental health consultation and confidential assessment, counselling services (individual and small group), and referrals. Many of these programs are connected with Health Services, which you may contact by phone. 

The [Student Services website](https://www.uvic.ca/studentaffairs/departments/student-services/index.php) lists several policies that you might want to know about and may make your life at UVic safer and easier. Only some of them are directly related to this course, but all of them are still important.
